# Welcome to the Splunk Security Research Team's Security Content Project!

This project gives you access to our repository of Analytic Stories that are security guides which provide background on TTPs, mapped to the MITRE framework, the Lockheed Martin Kill Chain, and CIS controls. They include Splunk searches, machine-learning algorithms, and Splunk Phantom playbooks (where available)â€”all designed to work together to detect, investigate, and respond to threats.

This content is available via Splunk Enterprise Security, [Splunkbase](https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3449/) and can be explored on [research.splunk.com](research.splunk.com)  The security-content project was designed to bring all Splunk detection, and the community together to improve our collective defenses.
