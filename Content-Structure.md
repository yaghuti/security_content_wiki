# What's in an Analytic Story?

[Analytic Stories](https://github.com/splunk/security-content/blob/develop/docs/stories_categories.md) and their corresponding searches are composed of **.yml** files (manifests) and associated .conf files. The stories reside in [/stories](https://github.com/splunk/security-content/tree/develop/stories) and the searches live in [/detections](https://github.com/splunk/security-content/tree/develop/detections). 

Manifests contain a number of mandatory and optional fields. You can see the full field list for each piece of content [here](https://github.com/splunk/security-content/tree/develop/docs#spec-documentation).
