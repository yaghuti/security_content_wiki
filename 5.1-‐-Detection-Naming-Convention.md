# Summary 

Every time a Splunk Security Content analytic is created it should follow the naming convention below. This convention provides us consistent naming as well as organization for our different security content components. 

# Format

`<platform> <short_summary>`

### Where

* `<platform>`: Should represent the platform the detection is targeting AWS, GCP, Linux, Windows, MacOS, Splunk, etc.
* `<short_summary>`: A short and precise summary of the detection, ideally referencing the tooling or technique being detected. See `names should be` for limitations.

# Example

- Windows Registry Dump Via Reg
- Windows Network Scan Via Nmap
- Windows Potential Credential Dumping Activity
- Linux Auditd New User Added
- AWS Multi-Factor Authentication Disabled

# Names should:

* Be limited to 64 characters.
* Avoid starting with the word "detect".
* Be as clear and precise as possible in highlighting what the rule is trying to detect.
