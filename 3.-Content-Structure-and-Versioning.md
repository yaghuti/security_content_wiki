# Release Versioning

Each Splunk Security Content [release](https://github.com/splunk/security-content/releases) follows a 3 number structure: **\<major\>.\<minor\>.\<patch\>** for example `3.9.1`. The following is an explanation of what each number signifies and when the numbers change.

* **\<major\>** - This number pertains to the specification/schema version our content is adhering to. Today we are in spec 3.0. This number only changes when we make a schema change or update. 
* **\<minor\>** - This number pertains to the update we are on. This number increases every time we introduce a new piece of content. Examples of content include, but are not limited to, the following: detections, stories, responses, and so on.  
* **\<patch\>** - This number pertains to fixes for content. This number increases every time we resolve a bug with a current piece of content but do not introduce any new functionality.

We did not come up with this concept and are just implementing semantic versioning per https://semver.org/. Note that release announcements are only sent out for major and minor changes, but not usually for patches unless they contain critical issues that require communication.

# Content Versioning of yaml files
 * **version** - This number is an integer and is bumped every time a yaml file is changed
* **date** - This date string is updated every time the content is modified
