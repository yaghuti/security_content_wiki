# Writing Content

## Pre-Requisites 
Before you begin, follow the steps to install **dependencies**
1. Install `contentctl`. This requires Python 3.11 or Python 3.12. We recommend using [pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/) to install and manage it (`pipx install contentctl`).

## Writing Content
1. Select the content [piece](https://github.com/splunk/security-content/wiki/Content-Structure) you want to write. 
2. Copy an example and edit it to suit your needs. At a minimum, you must write [a detection search](https://github.com/splunk/security-content/tree/develop/detections).
3. Make a pull request. 

## Testing New Content
1. Run `contentctl validate` locally. This will ensure your new content or changes are all still valid.
2. If you'd like to run detection testing locally, you can run `contentctl test --no_enable-integration-testing  mode:changes --mode.target-branch develop` which will run unit testing for each detection that differs from the develop branch.

The pull request will trigger a GitHub Actions run, a continuous-integration app that integrates with a VCS and automatically runs a series of steps every time that it detects a change to your repository. A GitHub Actions run consists of a series of steps, usually build, test, and deployment. If your tests pass, you're good to go! A repository maintainer will make sure the PR makes it into the next release. Which will be deployed in the [ESCU app](https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3449/). If the GitHub Actions check fails, refer to [troubleshooting](https://github.com/splunk/security-content/wiki/Troubleshooting) first, some problems are easily described by CI. If not do not worry, our team will work with you in the PR to make sure your content passes validation and its part of our next release!
